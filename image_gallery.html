			<h1>Os Gemeos Gallery</h1>	
			<p>Os Gemeos (Otavio and Gustavo Pandolfo) are graffiti artists and identical twin brothers. They started painting graffiti in 1987 and gradually became a main influence in the local scene, helping to define Brazil's own style. Their work often features yellow-skinned characters - taken from the yellow tinge both of the twins have in their dreams - but is otherwise diverse and ranges from tags to complicated murals. Subjects range from family portraits to commentary on Sao Paulo's social and political circumstances, as well as Brazilian folklore. Their graffiti style was influenced by both traditional hip hop style and the Brazilian culture</p>
